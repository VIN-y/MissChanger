# ASSEMBLING

### Endstops Assembly

The endstops assembly is held in place by replacing the original two M3x30mm bolts with two M3x35mm bolts, which passed through the holes on the Y motor mount assembly. 

The X endstop trigger is mounted to the back of the original Tap_Center using an M3x30mm bolt, which go through centre hole of the linear rail. There is a slot to add a M3 nut on the trigger.

**Note:** Do not insert the threaded insert for the centre hole, see picture below. Alternatively (if you are reusing parts from a functional Voron-Tap), the threading can be drilled out with a 3mm bit.

### Tool Changer

The tool changer mechanism requires 3 modded pieces: the tap front, the print-head rear, and the locker.

For the print-head rear. Two threaded inserts are needed. There is a insert slot for the pogo pin pad on the side. On the other side, are aligner pin slots to mate with the dock; which will need 2 of 3mm sleeves. Finally, on the back, there are 2 of 3x20mm chamferred pins, which are pressed into place (they will butt up against the threaded 

The locker required a M3x12mm bolt on the side, as shown in the picture below.

**Note:** (1) the pogo pin pad on the print-head rear needs to be female, as the pins would be live during operation. (2) the chamfer on the pin should be increased (rounded if possible), for better mating procedure.
