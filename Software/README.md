### [kiauh: Klipper Installation And Update Helper](https://github.com/dw-0/kiauh)

Beside the usual benefits of KIAUH; i.e.: update, rollback, etc. KIAUH also provides an extra (optional) extension called `[G-Code Shell Command]`, which will be needed for the printer mode toggle, between multi-toolheads and single-toolhead mode.

### [klipper-toolchanger: Toolcahnging extension for Klipper](https://github.com/viesturz/klipper-toolchanger)

This is the main extension for the tool changer. However, MissChanger deviate greatly from that of the original creator (Viesturz); thus, it's config are not compatible with other projects like Tapchanger and DraftShift.
