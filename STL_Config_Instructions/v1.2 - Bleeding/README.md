# V1.2

## 1. Introduction

Although the setting up the config for MissChanger will change some aspects of your printer, it is still recommended that you start the project with a functional printer with Voron-Tap, then add MissChanger and one tool-head at a time.

This document will not guide you through the set up of CAN bus or the physical mounting of the related hardware (i.e. U2C and tool-head board), please refer to the manufactureâ€™s manual for that.

## 2. Hardware

### 2.1. MissChanger Core

The following manual is for the core components that are needed to get MissChanger up and running.

MissChanger Assembly Manual: [MissChanger_Assembly_Manual.pdf](./MissChanger_Assembly_Manual.pdf) 

For the Voron 2.4 300mm, or smaller, you will also need: [Inverted z-chain](https://www.printables.com/model/445298-inverted-z-chain-for-voron). To clear the space in front of the back gantry extrusion for the umbilicals.

### 2.2. Optional

These following attachments are extras that will expand the capability of tool-changer system. Nevertheless, they were developed by others and does not share the same design language as MissChanger (i.e. difference print parameters).

* Nevermore Stealth Max (with MissChanger channel switcher user mod)
* DC Barrel Panel Mount - for cable management of the Nevermore Stealth Max

## 3. Software

This section aims to provide a guide through the installation process of the software and setup the config.

### 3.1. Installation

To install the [VIN-y/klipper-toolchanger](https://github.com/VIN-y/klipper-toolchanger) plugin, run the following installation script using the following command over SSH. This script will download this GitHub repository to your RaspberryPi home directory, and symlink the files in the Klipper extra folder.

```
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VIN-y/klipper-toolchanger/main/install.sh | bash
```

Then, add the following to your `moonraker.conf` to enable automatic updates:

```
[update_manager klipper-toolchanger]
type: git_repo
channel: dev
path: ~/klipper-toolchanger
origin: https://github.com/VIN-y/klipper-toolchanger.git
managed_services: klipper
primary_branch: main
install_script: install.sh
```

### 3.2. Configuration

The configuration files can be found in the [Klipper_Config](./Klipper_Config) folder, where further descriptions of each config file can also be found. If you are comfortable with it, you are welcome to dig through and play the configs files in whichever order you refer. Nevertheless, the following are the recommended steps to get the software up-and-running. The guide bellow will also make it easier for you to get support.

#### Step 1: Back-up your running system

Through your web interface:

1. Select all of your config files

2. Download it to your computer

#### Step 2: Create the 'Other' and 'Session Variables' section in `printer.cfg`

These sections need to be placed just before the 'SAVE_CONFIG' section, as shown in the sample `printer.cfg`. Everything below the `Section Variable marker` will be swap in and out upon `A_CONFIG_TOGGLE`.

The content of the sections is as follow:

```

```

If a function settings were already existing somewhere else, the old function will need to be removed, or transfer to the new location. The critical settings that needs to be changed are as follow:

* `[quad_gantry_level]`, increase the y position of the  front 2 `points:` to 130, as shown, to avoid crashing into the dock.
* `[bed_mesh]`, make sure that `mesh_min: 30,130` , as shown, to avoid crashing into the dock.

#### Step 3: Add the necessary config

The following files are contains the key settings and macros that are needed for the printer, and will need to be add to your config folder via the web interface:

* `toolchanger.cfg`

* `toolchanger-calibrate.cfg`

* `toolchanger-homing.cfg` 

* `toolchanger-nozzle_clean.cfg`
1. Include this ones to the top of your `printer.cfg`:
   
   ```
   [include toolchanger.cfg]
   [include toolchanger-homing.cfg]
   [include toolchanger-calibrate.cfg]
   ```

2. Include these ones under the 'Session Variables' section in your `printer.cfg`:
   
   ```
   [include toolchanger-nozzle_clean.cfg]
   ```

3. Add the 'Global Variables' macro in `printer.cfg`. The `[gcode_macro _global_variable]` can be found in `printer.cfg`, at the top of the file. Each variable has been given a short description on what they do and some variable can be used to disable functionalities, such that you will not need to comb through the configs to find and edit them out. The macro is as follow:
   
   ```

   gcode:                                       # This is here to appease klipper
   ```

4. Also in `printer.cfg`, disable `[safe_z_home]` (comment-out or delete)

*Note: Further configuration in the `calibrate-offsets.cfg`  will be needed to calibrate the calibration probe, see **section 4**.* 

#### Step 4: Make the reference tool-head config file

Use the `T0-SB2209-Revo-LDO.cfg` as references.

1. Transfer the items relating to the tool-head from your `printer.cfg` to a separate file:
   
   * `[mcu EBBCan0]` - the MCU for your tool-head, named to your liking, i.e. EBBCan0.
   
   * `[adxl345]` - The accelerometer on the tool-head.
   
   * `[resonance_tester]` 
   
   * `[temperature_sensor]`
   
   * `[extruder]`
   
   * `[tmc2209]` - that is associated extruder motor
   
   * `[verify_heater]`
   
   * `[fan]` - This is to be replaced with `[multi_fan]`
   
   * `[heater_fan]`
   
   * `[neopixel]` - if applicable
   
   * `[tool_probe]` - Notice that the `activate_gcode:` for the item has been replace with the macro `_TAP_PROBE_ACTIVATE`, which can be found in `toolchanger.cfg`

2. Add the following item and macro:
   
   * `[gcode_macro T0]` - for tool switching
   
   * `[tool T0]` - associate the items above to T0 and provide tool specific variables (which will need to be adjusted later).

3. Include tool-head config in the session variables are in `printer.cfg`, as shown in the code block in **step 2**.

4. Copy and paste the following section into the `printer.cfg` under the "SAVE_CONFIG" section, if they are not already there.
   
   ```
   #*# [tool_probe T0]
   #*# z_offset = 0.0
   #*#
   #*# [extruder]
   #*# control = pid
   #*# pid_kp = 36.501
   #*# pid_ki = 4.124
   #*# pid_kd = 80.760
   ```

*Note: At this point, the printer should be able to have a firmware restart without (or with minor) errors.* 

#### Step 5: Calibrate and test T0

1. Remove the dock and any attached tool-head other than T0 (for safety reason).

2. Run `FIRMWARE_RESTART` , and fix any problem that arise ;)

3. Run `G28` and `QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL` 

4. Check that:
   
   * The printer home Y before X
   
   * Quad gantry level front points are at Y130
   
   * Extruder PID is correctly set and applied (no error, no bouncing temperature)

5. Re-mount the dock

6. Calibrate the park position, see **section 4.1.** 

7. Calibrate the `z_offset`, see **section 4.3.** 

8. (optional) Calibrate input shaper, see **section 4.2.** 

#### Step 6: Make the next tool-head and its config file

1. The hardware assembly for all tool-heads are the same

2. Mount the dock and temporary mount the new tool-head to the dock - CAUTION: do not try to make the print pick up the tool yet.

3. Use `T1-SB2209-Revo-LDO.cfg` config file as references. Make, calibrate and test the config files for the other tool-heads.

4. Replace the `canbus_uuid` for that of your particular tool-head.

5. Include tool-head config in the session variables are in `printer.cfg`, as shown in the code block in **step 2**.

6. Copy and paste the following section into the `printer.cfg` under the "SAVE_CONFIG" section, if they are not already there. Swap out `[tool T1]`, `[tool_probe T1]`, and `[extruder1]` for the relevant tool-head.
   
   ```
   #*# [tool T1]
   #*# gcode_x_offset = 0.0
   #*# gcode_y_offset = 0.0
   #*# gcode_z_offset = 0.0
   #*#
   #*# [tool_probe T1]
   #*# z_offset = 0.0
   #*#
   #*# [extruder1]
   #*# control = pid
   #*# pid_kp = 36.501
   #*# pid_ki = 4.124
   #*# pid_kd = 80.760
   ```

7. Save & Restart

#### Step 7: Calibrate and test the new tool-head

NOTE: if this is the first tool-head you made that is not the reference tool-head. Then you will need to test the max available y of your set up.

1. Run `G28`

2. Manually nudge the tool-head to right behind a docked tool, but not touching

3. Note down the Y position of that location

4. If the y location is greater than 120, then you will need to update the `params_safe_y` in `[toolchanger]` in `toolchanger.cfg`

Otherwise:

1. PID tune the hotend

2. Save & Restart

3. Disable the motors and push the tool-head toward the back - To account for the front of the gantry over sagging

4. Run `G28` and `QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL`

5. Calibrate the park position, see **section 4.1.** 

6. Calibrate the `z_offset`, see **section 4.3.** 

7. (optional) Calibrate input shaper, see **section 4.2.** 

#### Step 8: Other macros

* `macro-general.cfg`

* `macro-print.cfg`

* etc.

These configs tends to be points of customisation for many. Therefore, the included files are intended to be inspirations for your own macros. They contains commands and functionalities that may not be relevant to user's printer, i.e. lighting, skew profile, chamber thermistor.

## 4. Calibration

This section assumes that the new tool-head has been assembled, wired up, and has been recognised by Klipper.

### 4.1. Park position calibration

1. Run `G28` and `QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL`  - if not already done

2. Run `G1 Z150 F9000` 

3. Run `STOP_TOOL_PROBE_CRASH_DETECTION` 

4. On the web interface, in `Setting > Control` add `0.1` and remove `100` in the `Move distance increments X & Y axes (in mm)` - *Note: This is temporary for this step only, and can be changed back afterwards.*

5. Set the dock at the empty position, i.e. at the bottom of the ramp.
   ![](./images/20240730_194812.jpg)

6. Use the web interface, nudge the tool-head into the correct x-position. This can be tested by nudging the y-position in and out to see which side of the tool-head touch the dock first. Then adjusts it, such that both side of the dock would touch the tool-head at the same time.
   ![](./images/20240730_195442.jpg)

7. Copy and paste the current x-coordinate into the `params_park_x:` of the config file of the current tool-head

8. Save it, **BUT DON'T RESTART**

9. Nudge the y-position until the dock is at the peak of the ramp. - The dock is tough enough to handle a bit of pressure from the gantry. So you can keep nudging the y-position until the dock flex a bit, then back it off.

10. Run:
    
    ```
    G91
    G1 Y+80 F6000
    G90
    ```

11. Copy and paste the current y-coordinate into the `params_park_y:` of the config file of the current tool-head

12. Save it

13. Run `FIRMWARE_RESTART`

14. Run the `A_DOCKING_TEST` macro

### 4.2. Input Shaper (optional)

*Note: To avoid Klipper from throwing errors, the parameters for input shaper are pre-populated in* `toolchanger.cfg` *and in each tool-head config files. Nevertheless, it is best to calibrate it for each available tool-head.*

1. Enable (un-comment) the `[adxl345]` and `[resonance_tester]` in the config of the tool-head that is to be calibrated

2. Disable (comment out) the `[adxl345]` and `[resonance_tester]` in the config of the other tool-heads

3. Save & Restart

4. Mount the tool-head that is to be calibrated

5. Run `G28` and `QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL`

6. Run `SHAPER_CALIBRATE` - **BUT, DO NOT SAVE**

7. From the console output, save the following parameters into the tool-head config (at the bottom of the `[tool Tx]` section)
   
   ```
   params_input_shaper_type_x: ...
   params_input_shaper_freq_x: ...
   params_input_shaper_damping_ratio_x: ...
   params_input_shaper_type_y: ...
   params_input_shaper_freq_y: ...
   params_input_shaper_damping_ratio_y: ...
   ```

8. Save & Restart

### 4.3. Calibrate Offsets

#### 4.3.1. Calibrate Reference tool-head

1. Mount tool-head T0

2. Go to T0 config file
   
   - Comment out the `z_offset` under `[tool_probe T0]`  - if it is not already is
   
   - Set every other offsets to 0
   
   - Save it, **BUT DON'T RESTART**

3. Run `G28` and `QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL`

4. Run `PROBE_CALIBRATE` on the console and go through the process with the normal paper test

5. Run `SAVE_CONFIG` - which will restart your printer

6. Go back to `printer.cfg`

7. Copy the z-offset value from:
   
   ```
   #*# [tool_probe_endstop]
   #*# z_offset = {value}
   ```
   
   And, paste it to:
   
   ```
   #*# [tool_probe T0]
   #*# z_offset = {value}
   ```

8. Delete (It will not be used by the system regardless of whether it is there or not):
   
   ```
   #*# [tool_probe_endstop]
   #*# z_offset = {value}
   ```

9. Save & Restart

*Note: it is key that you get the z_offset correct for the T0, as it will be used to extrapolate other offsets later on. Therefore, it is worth diverge from the instruction, if you have a preferred way to set your the z-offset.*

#### 4.3.2. Nudge Probe Calibration

At this stage, you should have:

- The Nudge probe assembled, tested, and installed

- T0 z_offset calibrated

This section will guide you through the calibration of the `trigger_to_bottom_z` for the probe, which will allow you to automate the z_offsets of the tool-heads that are not T0. This should be your go to variable to adjust whenever you ran into z-offset issue.

#### Steps and note:

1. Go to `printer.cfg` and record the `z-offset` for `#*# [tool_probe T0]`, which should be at (or near) the bottom of the file

2. Open `calibrate-offsets.cfg`

3. Set it to the correct `pin:` in `[tools_calibrate]`

4. Set the approximate XY location of the Nudge pin in `[gcode_macro _CALIBRATE_MOVE_OVER_PROBE]`

5. Save and restart

6. Mount tool-head **T0** and make sure it's nozzle is clean

7. **<mark>!!! MAKE SURE THE NUDGE PROBE IS NOT MOUNTED !!!</mark>** 

8. Run `G28` and `QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL`

9. Mount the Nudge probe

10. Run `CALIBRATE_NPO` - **BUT, DO NOT SAVE**

11. Look at the proposed offset and compare it to the recorded `z_offset` from step 1. Take the different and put it in the `trigger_to_bottom_z:` in `[tools_calibrate]`. Be mindful of the direction, remember: **Decrease -> higher nozzle**.

12. Restart and repeat steps 8-10 until the proposed z-offset to be +-0.01mm of the recorded `z_offset` in **step 1**

Your Nudge probe is ready. 

*Note: It is worth mentions that there are other ways to calibrate your offsets beside the Nudge, such as the visual based solution from [Ember](https://www.emberprototypes.com/products/cxc) or the calibration print that you can get from [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/201707-x-y-and-z-calibration-tool-for-idex-dual-extruder-). Each with their pros and cons, in term of accuracy and cost. However, Nudge is currently the only way to automatically calibrate all relevant offsets.*

#### 4.3.3. Other tool-head(s)

#### Steps and note:

1. Mount tool-head T0 and make sure it's nozzle is clean

2. <mark>**!!! MAKE SURE THE NUDGE PROBE IS NOT MOUNTED !!!**</mark> 

3. Heat all tool-head to 150Â°C and wait ~3 mins for them to stabilised - some hot-ends have large heat block, which may not be fully thermally expanded.

4. Run `G28` and `QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL`

5. Make sure all nozzles are clean

6. Go to each tool-head config, comment out:
   
   - gcode_x_offset
   
   - gcode_y_offset
   
   - gcode_z_offset
   
   - z_offset

7. Save it, **BUT DON'T RESTART**

8. Mount the Nudge probe

9. Run `CALIBRATE_OFFSETS` - the process is automatic, and you can specify a specific tool-head

10. Run `SAVE_CONFIG`

## 5. Slicer Profile

### Custom Start G-code

Copy and paste the following code into your slicer.

```
PRINT_START BED_TEMP=[first_layer_bed_temperature] FIRST_LAYER_PRINT_SIZE=[first_layer_print_size] TOOL=[initial_tool] TOOL_TEMP={first_layer_temperature[initial_tool]} {if is_extruder_used[0]}T0_TEMP={first_layer_temperature[0]} T0_Fil={filament_type[0]}{endif} {if is_extruder_used[1]}T1_TEMP={first_layer_temperature[1]} T1_Fil={filament_type[1]}{endif} {if is_extruder_used[2]}T2_TEMP={first_layer_temperature[2]} T2_Fil={filament_type[2]}{endif} {if is_extruder_used[3]}T3_TEMP={first_layer_temperature[3]} T3_Fil={filament_type[3]}{endif} {if has_wipe_tower}WIPE_TOWER_X=[wipe_tower_x] WIPE_TOWER_Y=[wipe_tower_y]{endif}
```

Like so:

![](./images/Screenshot%20from%202024-11-06%2023-12-57.png)

### Speed profile

The printer bed shape need to be set as shown below, to avoid collisions with the dock during printing.

*Note: It can be seen here that the max print height was set to 235mm. This is recommended for new machines to avoid umbilical tangling. However, if you are willing to do some tuning to the tension of the umbilical or add a top hat to the system, the max print height can be increased to 250mm or 300mm.*

![](./images/Slicer_bed_shape.png)

Although, you might want to tune your own speed profile for the best performance. Here is a slow and reliable profile to get you started with.

![](./images/Slicer_Speed.png)
