# MissChanger
A Stealth Burner tool-change system for Voron 2.4 and Trident.

This project was inspired by [tapchanger](https://github.com/viesturz/tapchanger/) and [Voron-Tap](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Tap/).

## Description
Misschanger aims to be a tool-changing mechanism that is compatitble with both Voron Trident and Voron 2.4.
While also retaining the MGN9H tapping system of Voron-Tap.

At the moment, it is only compatible with the Stealth Burner toolhead, with the Revo-Voron hotend.

## Software
This project use the same [toolchanger extension](https://github.com/viesturz/klipper-toolchanger/) and Klipper setup as [tapchanger](https://github.com/viesturz/tapchanger/).
